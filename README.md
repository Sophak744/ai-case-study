Ways2Well
## Company Overview  
Brigham began his career as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. During his tenure, he identified numerous flaws within the healthcare system. Most notably, he realized that there was a greater emphasis on prescribing medications that were brokered or partnered with by insurance companies and Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), rather than on the actual health outcomes of patients. He also observed that the system was more reactive, focusing on treatment after the onset of symptoms, instead of proactive disease prevention. As a result of that, Brigham decided to establish a company using a proactive approach, dedicated to preventive health and offering personalized healthcare services that prioritize accurate prescription therapies with the help of AI. Operating independently, Ways2Well currently has no external investors or fundraising efforts, allowing the company to maintain its mission driven focus without outside influence. [1]

## Ways2Well Objective and Business Model
Amid the rising dianosis of chronic diseases, autoummune disorders, and pre diabetic conditions, Ways2Well is committed to promoting early detection and awareness. Their comprehensive bloodwork tests are designed for healthy individuals seeking to maintain wellness, those with pre-diagnosed conditions exploring alternatives, and anyone interested in advanced diagnostic technology. This approach includes detailed bloodwork analysis and personalized consultations to discuss results. Furthermore, Ways2Well stands out by offering regenerative therapy using stem cells and utilizing AI to develop personalized health plans based on the analysis of over 60 biomarkers.

## Technology and  Unique Solutions
Ways2Well is a pioneer in the health and wellness industry, leveraging AI as a virtual healthcare assistant powered by a large language model. This AI provides patients with real-time information and guidance, drawing from peer-reviewed studies, journal articles, and clinician-reviewed data. The key advantage of Ways2Well over its competitors is its AI chatbot, (Allen.) Allen can answer health and wellness questions, offer insights on preventive care, and help users understand complex medical concepts. This innovation eliminates the need for lengthy calls with healthcare providers. Instead, users can simply log into the app and ask Allen their questions. As Brigham Buhler noted in a conversation with Joe Rogan, "Who has time to be on the phone with a provider for 40 minutes? With Allen, that's no problem. Just log into the app, and Allen provides a comprehensive response instantly!" [2]

## Recommendations

My recommendation is to increase accessibility and reach.  To do that, Ways2Well could consider expanding through mobile clinics or satellite offices across more states. This expansion would provide greater flexibility for patients, particularly those on a budget, and enhance data collection capabilities. This additional data could further refine patient outcomes and bolster the company's AI capabilities, enhancing its competitive edge in the healthcare industry.
