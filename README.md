Ways2Well
## Company Overview  
Brigham Buhler began his career as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. During his tenure, he identified numerous flaws within the healthcare system. Most notably, he realized that there was a greater emphasis on prescribing medications that were brokered or partnered with by insurance companies and Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), rather than on the actual health outcomes of patients. He also observed that the system was more reactive, focusing on treatment after the onset of symptoms, instead of proactive disease prevention. As a result of that, Brigham decided to establish a founded Ways2Well in 2017 and launced in 2018 using a proactive approach, dedicated to preventive health and offering personalized healthcare services that prioritize accurate prescription therapies with the help of AI. Operating independently, Ways2Well currently has no external investors or fundraising efforts, allowing the company to maintain its mission driven focus without outside influence. [1]

## Ways2Well Business and Competitors
Amid the rising diagnosis of chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders, and pre-diabetic conditions, Ways2Well is committed to promoting early detection and awareness. In the competitive Health and Wellness industry, Ways2Well ranks 56th out of approximately 92 active competitors. [2] What sets them apart is their early adoption of AI technology.  Even their biggest competitors such as Informed DNA or Genwiz [3] are still in the proces of leveraging AI for their business.  Their main target consumers are not only healthy individuals looking to maintain wellness but also those with pre-diagnosed conditions open to exploring alternatives and anyone interested in advanced diagnostic technology. This approach includes detailed bloodwork analysis and personalized consultations. Additionally, Ways2Well offers regenerative therapy using stem cells and utilizes AI to develop personalized health plans based on the analysis of over 60 biomarkers.

## Technology and Unique Solutions
Ways2Well is a pioneer in the health and wellness industry, leveraging AI as a virtual healthcare assistant powered by a large language model. This AI provides patients with real-time information and guidance, drawing from peer-reviewed studies, journal articles, and clinician-reviewed data. The key advantage of Ways2Well over its competitors is its AI chatbot, (Allen.) Allen can answer health and wellness questions, offer insights on preventive care, and help users understand complex medical concepts. This innovation eliminates the need for lengthy calls with healthcare providers. Instead, users can simply log into the app and ask Allen their questions. As Brigham Buhler noted in a conversation with Joe Rogan, "Who has time to be on the phone with a provider for 40 minutes? With Allen, that's no problem. Just log into the app, and Allen provides a comprehensive response instantly!" [4]

## Recommendations

My recommendation is to increase accessibility and reach. Ways2Well could expand through mobile clinics or satellite offices in more states. With the help of AI, they can identify which states or cities show the most interest, helping to determine optimal locations for these clinics or offices. This expansion would offer greater flexibility for patients, especially those on a budget, and improve data collection capabilities. The additional data could refine patient outcomes and strengthen the company's AI capabilities, enhancing its competitive edge in the healthcare industry.
