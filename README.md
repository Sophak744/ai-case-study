Ways2Well
## Company Overview  
Brigham began his career as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. During his tenure, he identified numerous flaws within the healthcare system. Most notably, he realized that there was a greater emphasis on prescribing medications that were brokered or partnered with by insurance companies and Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), rather than on the actual health outcomes of patients. He also observed that the system was more reactive, focusing on treatment after the onset of symptoms, instead of proactive disease prevention. Armed with this insight, Brigham decided to establish a company dedicated to preventive health and offering personalized healthcare services that prioritize accurate prescription therapies with the help of AI. 

## Ways2Well Objective and Business Model
With a substantial increase in chronic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and pre-diabetic diagnoses, Ways2Well is dedicated to significantly raising early awareness and adopting a proactive, rather than waiting until the patient is diagnosed. That is why Ways2Well focuses on preventative care to address the rise in chornic diseases and pre diabetic conditions by promoting early awareness and personalized interventions. This service is designed for people who are healthy and wish to maintain their well-being, for those with pre-diagnosed conditions seeking alternatives, or anyone interested in using state of the art technology to identify potential diseases. This approach involves comprehensive bloodwork and personalized one on one consultations to discuss the results in detail. Additionally, Ways2Well distinguishes itslef with regenerative therapy using stem cells and an AI-driven approach to create personalized healh plans based on comprehensive bloodwork analzying over 60 biomarkers.

## Technology and  Unique Solutions
Ways2Well is a pioneer in the health and wellness industry, leveraging AI as a virtual healthcare assistant powered by a large language model. This AI provides patients with real-time information and guidance, drawing from peer-reviewed studies, journal articles, and clinician-reviewed data. The key advantage of Ways2Well over its competitors is its AI chatbot, Allen. Allen can answer health and wellness questions, offer insights on preventive care, and help users understand complex medical concepts. This innovation eliminates the need for lengthy calls with healthcare providers. Instead, users can simply log into the app and ask Allen their questions. As Brigham Buhler noted in a conversation with Joe Rogan, "Who has time to be on the phone with a provider for 40 minutes? With Allen, that's no problem. Just log into the app, and Allen provides a comprehensive response instantly!" 

## Recommendations

To increase accessibility and reach, Ways2Well could consider expanding through mobile clinics or satellite offices across more states. This expansion would provide greater flexibility for patients, particularly those on a budget, and enhance data collection capabilities. This additional data could further refine patient outcomes and bolster the company's AI capabilities, enhancing its competitive edge in the healthcare industry.
